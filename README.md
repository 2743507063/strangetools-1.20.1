### **__Strange Tools__**

**Introduction**  
Strange Tools transforms Minecraft with unique tools and armor crafted from over 20 unconventional materials (including vanilla items never used for crafting before). Each material brings distinct properties, adding strategic depth and fun mechanics to your adventures.

**Key Features**

##### 1\. **Unique Materials & Gear**

*   Forge full tool sets (swords, pickaxes, axes, shovels, hoes) from materials like copper, emerald, lapis, redstone, quartz, cake, obsidian, glowstone, nether star, and moreâ€”each with custom durability, mining speed, and attack stats. Emerald armor is also available with exclusive properties.

##### 2\. **Special Effects**

*   Every tool/armor has unique abilities:
*   Copper tools: Chance to ignite targets
*   Emerald tools: Extra emerald drops from enemies
*   Quartz tools: Bonus magic damage
*   Ender alloy tools: Teleport behind targets (25% chance)
*   And many more dynamic effects

##### 3\. **Version Notes**

*   Starting from version 0.06beta, the Cloth Config API has become an optional dependency. Versions prior to 0.06beta still require the Cloth Config API.

*   Forge/NeoForge players can use the Sinytra Connector mod, as I haven't planned to develop a Forge/NeoForge version for now.
